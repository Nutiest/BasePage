		<h1> My Three Favorite Parts about Being 16 </h1>
	</header>

	<section id= "content">
		<h2> Number One </h2>
		<p> In the days coming up to my birthday I seem to be happier and happier. I become more excited, and I can't wait until I can drive. I'll have to wait another week until I can test for my Drivers License, but thats ok. I don't have many super important places to go to by myself anyway.

	<section id= "middle">
		<h2> Number Two </h2>
		<p> There's a sense of maturity that comes with being 16 that feels so great. There's just so much freedom and responsibility that I've been oh so waiting for. When I turn 16 I'm honestly just gonna drive aroudn for fun.

	<aside id= "sidebar">
		<h2> Number Three </h2>
		<p> My birthday is on Valentine's Day so it's funny to see people freak out when they realize when my birthday is. I'm a quiet person in general, so typically people have to find out through other people blurting it out the day before my birthday. And since my birthday is on Valentine's Day I get leeway with not really having to get my valentine a gift (Even though I do anyway).
